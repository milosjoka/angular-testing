# Angular testing

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.4.

## Types of tests

### Unit test
A unit test checks the functionality of the smallest testable elements of an application
Unit tests prove that given some input the function returns the expected output. A collection of unit tests makes up a test suite.

### Integration test
Verify that several units works together as expected.


### End-to-end test
Helper robot that behaves like a user to click around the app and verify that it functions correctly
End-to-end testing is a methodology used in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to test the functionality and performance of an application under product-like circumstances and data to replicate live settings. The goal is to simulate what a real user scenario looks like from start to finish. The completion of this testing is not only to validate the system under test, but to also ensure that its sub-systems work and behave as expected.
End to end testing (E2E testing) is a software testing method that involves testing an applicationâ€™s workflow from beginning to end. This method aims to replicate real user scenarios to validate the system for integration and data integrity.
Essentially, the test goes through every operation the application can perform to test how the application communicates with hardware, network connectivity, external dependencies, databases, and other applications. Usually, E2E testing is executed after functional and system testing is complete.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
